# Main Concept

- Vigenère cipher

## Explanation

The hints provided in the problem suggest that the content of `ct.txt` is encrypted using the `Vigenère cipher`.
Additionally, the reference to "autos" in the problem statement indicates that the encryption method is likely `Autokey Vigenère`.

Selecting the **"Autokey Vigenère"** option and inputting the contents of `ct.txt` will produce the decrypted text along with the flag.
